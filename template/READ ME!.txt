Hi! Thanks for downloading UNITY PARTY engine by Rei the Goat on Gamejolt! 
Programmed entirely by Rei the Goat.

---------------------------------------------------
This is a template bundle for V.PUBLIC ALPHA BUILD 1 of Unity Party!
To get started, you can go to C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Rei\FridayNight\Songs and put export!
It should then look like C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Rei\FridayNight\Songs\Template
You got it? Cool! Now have fun modifying the package to however you want and add your own song !

---------------------------------------------------
SONGS: 
The Instrumental is always named Inst and is in .ogg format
same for the Voices, it's Voices.ogg
The Chart is the same as the Original FNF one, just import the difficulty you want!

META: 
The bundle has a meta file which has the main infos of the bundle such as name and author.
All songs have their own meta too!
All the text in "" supports RGB, Italic and Bold, 
just simply do <color=#RGB>text</color> for colors
<b>text</b> for bold
<i>text</i> for italic
They also stack up! so you can do <color=red><b>Bold Red Text</color></b>

COVER :
It's an image that can be put in every songs, it's a square resolution, you can modify the template one or make it bigger
or if you don't know what to put, you can delete it and it'll put a basic one with the FNF logo!

SONG LIST:
The songs in a bundle are in alphabetical order unless you put 01-99 as start of the folder name, they won't show up in-game tho!
It serves as a way to organize songs without annoyance.

---------------------------------------------------
Sorry if there isn't anything like a Character creator yet, it is in the work as it is an ALPHA! We've got a lot of plans for this engine.
Stay tuned!
